A tool to collect and export network performance metrics on devices like WLAN Pi and Raspberry Pi.
This tool was inspired by [wiperf](https://github.com/wifinigel/wiperf) project.

## Documentation

Documentation can be found from [Uption wiki](https://github.com/uption/uption/wiki).

## Installation

### Cargo

When installed as a standalone executable, Uption will read configuration from the current folder or
alternatively you can move the configuration file to `/etc/uption/`.

```sh
cargo install -f uption
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uption/uption/master/uption.toml
uption
```

### Debian package

Get the latest Debian package from [Releases](https://github.com/uption/uption/releases). Debian
package allows installing Uption as a systemd service and the default configuration file is copied
to `/etc/uption/`.

```sh
dpkg -i uption_x.y.z_amd64.deb
sudo systemctl enable uption
sudo systemctl start uption
```
